      There are 2 types of free COVID-19 tests available online from the HSE:
       * antigen tests (home test kits)
       * PCR tests (done at a test centre and sent to a lab)
  utter_covid_test_2:
  - text: |-
      * Antigen test is an extra measure to help protect yourself and others from COVID-19 (coronavirus).
       * You do the tests yourself. You use a swab to take a sample from your nose.
       * Unlike a COVID-19 PCR test, the test sample does not have to go to a lab.
       You usually get your result in 15 minutes.
  utter_covid_test_3:
  - text: |-
      You can get a PCR test if you have symptoms and you:
       * are age 55 or older and have not had a COVID-19 vaccine booster dose
       * have a high-risk medical condition
       * have a weak immune system (immunocompromised)
       * live in the same household as a person who has a weak immune system or provide support or care for them
       * are pregnant
       * are a healthcare worker
       If you have a positive antigen test, you can book a PCR test if you need a COVID-19 Recovery Cert.

      Fever in adults:

       * Your body’s normal temperature is between 36 and 36.8 degrees Celsius.
       * A high temperature or fever, for most people, is when your body temperature is 38 degrees Celsius or higher. This can be a sign that you are unwell. It usually means you have an infection such as a cold. But it can also be due to more serious infections, such as COVID-19 (coronavirus).
       * Even if you don’t have a high temperature you may still be seriously ill. So it's important to look at all your symptoms.
       * A fever is usually caused by your body fighting a viral or bacterial infection.
       * A fever usually lasts 3 to 5 days and most people will recover from a mild fever with self-care at home.

      Drink more fluids when you feel any dehydration symptoms. The best fluids to drink are water or oral rehydration sachets.

       If you find it hard to drink because you feel sick or have been vomiting, start with small sips and then gradually drink more.

       Drink enough during the day so your pee is a pale clear colour.

       Drink plenty of fluids if you are vomiting, have diarrhoea or if you are sweating a lot. You might be at higher risk of dehydration at these times.
  utter_covid_symptom_14:
  - text: |-
      * If you're vomiting or have diarrhoea and are losing too much fluid, you need to put back the sugar, salts and minerals that your body has lost.
       * Your pharmacist can recommend oral rehydration sachets. These are powders that you mix with water and then drink.
       * Ask your pharmacist which ones are right for you or your child.

      Symptoms of dehydration in babies and children are similar to symptoms of dehydration in adults. Thirst is one of the earliest signs. If your child is thirsty, give them a drink.


      Other signs to also look out for in children and babies are:
       * complaints of a headache
       * fewer wet nappies than usual or their wet nappies may not feel as heavy (or be as wet) as usual

      Make sure that your child drinks enough fluids every day. This is especially important if your child is under 5 years old or is sick.

       The amount of fluid your child needs depends on how old they are, how active they are and how hot the weather is. But most children aged 1 to 4 years old need 6 to 8 drinks a day.

      you can to reduce your risk of getting COVID-19, for example, washing your hands,
      avoiding large gatherings of people, and staying away from anyone who is ill.

      to socially distance. Conditions that put people at risk of having severe illness
      when they get COVID-19 include heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, lung
      disease, and chronic kidney disease.

      A higher proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients are above 70 years old,
      however, there are new studies showing that how healthy the individual is matters
      more than their actual age when it comes to how severe their illness is.

      severe infection with COVID-19. If you are taking aspirin, it is important to continue
      taking as directed and to talk with your healthcare provider if you have any further
      questions. Only your healthcare provider should be making changes to your medications.

      Postpone elective procedures, surgeries, and non-urgent dental visits. For emergency

  utter_covid_pregnancy_1:
   - text: Yes. Pregnant women can receive COVID-19 vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines offer strong
      protection against severe illness from COVID-19.

      Increasing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination
      during pregnancy suggests that the benefits of vaccination during pregnancy outweigh
      potential risks whenever there is ongoing or anticipated community transmission
      of the virus.

      COVID-19 vaccination before or during pregnancy is especially important
      in settings with moderate to high community transmission or for women at higher
      individual risk of exposure or severe illness.

   - text: Numerous studies indicate that pregnant women with COVID-19 are more likely to develop
       severe illness compared with non-pregnant women. This means that pregnant women with COVID-19
       are more likely to require hospitalization, intensive care and invasive ventilation to help with breathing.

       In addition, compared with pregnant women without COVID-19, pregnant women with COVID-19 have an increased risk of preterm
       birth and of having babies that need neonatal intensive care. They might also have an increased risk of stillbirth and maternal
       death.

   - text: COVID-19 vaccines have been found to be highly effective in preventing severe illness,
      hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Based on experience with other vaccines
      used during pregnancy, all of the WHO EUL-approved COVID-19 vaccines are expected
      to work as well in pregnant women as in nonpregnant people.

      In addition, studies have shown that pregnant women who get COVID-19 vaccines develop
      antibodies that are present in babies umbilical cord blood. This suggests
      that babies may receive protective benefits from the vaccine, in addition to the
      benefits for pregnant women.

   - text: Yes. Getting vaccinated beforehand is an important way for women to protect themselves
      and their babies from COVID-19 during pregnancy. People who are trying to conceive
      can receive COVID-19 vaccines.

      In clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines, and in a large prospective study of couples
      trying to conceive, rates of becoming pregnant were the same for those receiving
      COVID-19 vaccines and those not receiving the vaccines .

      WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of COVID-19
      vaccination, and no pregnancy testing is needed prior to vaccination.

   - text: There have been very rare reports of a type of blood clot called cerebral venous
      sinus thrombosis among patients that have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
      Though very rare, the risk of certain blood clots appears to be highest in women
      aged 18.

      At this time, although the chance of blood clots occurring as a result of this vaccine
      is very low, the FDA and CDC have stated that the mRNA vaccines are the preferred
      vaccine.

      Individuals who have been vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine
      within the last 21 days who experience severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain,
      or shortness of breath should seek immediate evaluation.

  utter_covid_pregnancy_6:
   - text: Yes! Recent studies on pregnant people who received the COVID-19 vaccine during
      pregnancy demonstrate that immunity is passed to the baby. This immunity may offer
      protection against COVID-19 to your baby.

  utter_covid_pregnancy_7:
   - text: The COVID-19 vaccines are currently being offered to breastfeeding individuals. The
      COVID-19 vaccines are not believed to be a risk for breastfed infants of mothers
      who were vaccinated as any vaccine component that makes it into the breast milk
      is likely to be quickly inactivated when the milk is digested by the baby.


      In addition, recent studies demonstrate that your COVID-19 immunity can pass to
      the baby through the breast milk after you receive the vaccine. The Academy of Breastfeeding
      Medicine recommends that all breastfeeding individuals get a COVID-19 vaccine.

   - text: Stress, changes in weight and exercise, and other major lifestyle changes can affect
      periods. All of those changes are common during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies have
      also shown that some women who had COVID-19 experienced changes in the duration
      and flow of their menstrual cycles.

      Recently, some people have reported changes in their period after receiving the
      COVID-19 vaccine. People have reported changes in duration, flow, and symptoms such
      as pain. The NIH is funding studies to better understand these changes.

      This does not mean there is any link to miscarriages. There is now data from many
      women who have been vaccinated which suggests there is not an increased risk of
      pregnancy loss.

  utter_covid_pregnancy_9:
   - text: Studies of mating animals have demonstrated no evidence that COVID vaccines affect
      fertility. Follow-up data from vaccinated individuals of reproductive age as well
      as studies on patients before and after vaccination do not show any evidence that
      the COVID-19 vaccines cause fertility problems (problems trying to get pregnant)
      in women or men.
